## aframe-srl-utils

This is a repository of components developed by Sunflower Reality Labs at the University of Kansas.

Each component is in its own subdirectory, under components. The component 'template' is 
intented to be best practices with how to structure code for a component.

## Building

When developing and testing a component, construct an example to show your component in use.
If needed, you can include other srl components directly, though you may need to build them.
